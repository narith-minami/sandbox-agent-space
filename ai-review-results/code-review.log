- The review task checked for diffs and found none—`git diff`/`--cached` were empty, so no modified code exists to analyze.
- There’s an untracked `ai-review-results/` directory (just `code-review.log`), but it doesn’t contain source changes, so nothing to review there.
- With no code differences, there’s nothing further to review right now; let me know if you want to add or point me at specific changes.
