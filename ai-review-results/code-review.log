- Task tool ran a code review but found no staged/unstaged diffs to evaluate—only the autogenerated `ai-review-results/code-review.log`, so nothing actionable to flag.  
- With no code changes present, there’s nothing else to investigate; let me know if you’d like me to inspect a different commit, branch, or PR.
